## 6. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED RESEARCH:

Australia presents a test case for the assessment and consideration of the potential future development of small modular
reactors (SMRs). The country has extensive involvement across the nuclear fuel cycle in its broadest sense: being a leading
producer and exporter of uranium, the operator of a world-class research reactor, an active member of the Generation IV
International Forum, and an acknowledged leader in the development of novel solutions for the safe and responsible
management of radioactive waste (e.g. Synroc®). Australia also is a leader in the production of nuclear medicines and in the
applications of nuclear science, including accelerator and neutron beam science. Moreover, Australia has long-established and
internationally well-regarded nuclear safety and safeguards organisations, and regularly is rated among the first in the world for
nuclear security by the independent non-government organisation and global watchdog, the Nuclear Threat Initiative. However,
unlike states with similar energy consumption and economic profiles, Australia hitherto has chosen not to adopt nuclear power.

Notwithstanding this position, and not wishing to pre-empt future Australian Government energy policy, the Australian project
team acknowledges the recommendations of recent Federal and New South Wales parliamentary inquiries, which have called
on Australia to remove prohibitions on the introduction of nuclear power and actively to consider the development of SMRs
among other advanced power reactor technologies.

<!-- PageFooter=\"N-21/ Rev. 16 (April 18)\" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->

Within this context, the Australian project team will focus on four key pillars, or pre-requisites, for the potential future
consideration of SMRs in Australia, which also would be relevant for other end-user states that do not have existing nuclear
power programs:


### Pillar 1: Technology Readiness

Under this theme, the project team would focus on:

\\- the identification of near-term (10 to 15 years) deployable designs

\\- the capacity of those designs to be integrated into Australia's energy system, current National Electricity Market, possible
future electricity market structures - including off-grid applications, and in association with distributed energy resources
\\- the ability of respective technologies (including micro-reactors) to contribute to - and support - other economic activities,
including the generation of process heat for industrial applications, residential heating and cooling, desalination, and remote
industrial projects (e.g. operations in the extractive industries).

Pillar 2: Economic Viability

Under this theme, the project team would focus on:

\\- issues of market design, structure, and suitability

\\- economic factors that may hinder or aid the adoption of SMRs in potential end-user states, e.g. supply chains, pricing, level of
liberalisation, feed-in tariffs, and energy and climate policy settings

\\- what, if any, level of government support would be required and through what mechanism(s) that support may be
implemented

\\- projected costs of SMRs, including local costs

\\- financing - through conventional and/or potentially innovative means

\\- system costs

\\- economic benefits that might accrue were a non-nuclear power state to introduce SMRs, including the collateral benefits of
the implementation of advanced technology on local industries.

The project team would seek to obtain costings information from vendors and to examine opportunities to de-risk projects.
Where data is available, the team will also undertake cost analyses with regard to:

\\- commercial project structures for the delivery of SMR projects

\\- contracting models for SMR projects

\\- SMR project risk allocation and risk mitigation.

In the first phase of the project, the team will synthesise work undertaken by the Federal and New South Wales inquiries into
the economic viability of nuclear power in Australia. The team also would draw on evidence gathered by, reports prepared for,
and the findings and analysis of the South Australian Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission, as these materials would enable
discussion of the particular market structure and portfolio mix in Australia.

Pillar 3: Legal Authority

Under this theme, the project team will focus on the legal and regulatory framework and its cost impacts that likely will be
borne by a proponent seeking to introduce SMRs, including:

\\- the legal and regulatory infrastructure for SMRs, e.g .:

\\- as compared to such infrastructure for large NPPs

\\- the cost benefits arising from regulatory harmonisation and/or collaboration among regulators

\\- licensing models, processes, and appropriate regimes for SMRs, including consideration of the viability of utilisation of
vendor country-of-origin/experienced foreign safety assessments and design reviews.

Cost analyses also would be undertaken with regard to:

\\- the impact of international nuclear liability regimes on SMRs

\\- international transportation issues for SMRs.

Pillar 4: Social Acceptability

Under this theme, the project team would seek to identify and analyse:

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->

\\- the social acceptability of SMRs in Australia, including those issues specific to certain designs and vendor countries and the
potential opportunity costs associated with choices regarding vendor countries and technologies

\\- costs of human capital development

\\- costs of challenges regarding facility siting and any other issues regarding social and community consent

\\- the likely community benefit (including community benefit payments) arising from the introduction of SMRs

\\- the costs of any social means by which to enhance the probability of deployment.

Australian Contributions:

The Australian project team will contribute:

\\- information on Australian costs - e.g. regulatory, owners' costs, construction, OPEX (e.g. labour), etc.

\\- information on Australian electricity, industrial market, and energy policy settings, including: Australia's electricity
generation assets, the distribution network, investment trends, Federal and State energy policy, relevant Federal and State
nuclear inquiries, and the National Electricity Market's pricing mechanism

\\- methodologies for assessment of reactor designs - as Australia, through ANSTO, has done with Generation IV reactor designs
\\- information on the economics of resources/energy production and use

\\- information on nuclear law and regulation in Australia

\\- information on community and stakeholder engagement regarding nuclear activities and the establishment of nuclear
facilities.

The Australian project team will use this knowledge to develop mechanisms to enable:

\\- a systematic approach to economic appraisal to enable assessment of the suitability of SMRs and micro-reactors for
deployment

\\- a case study applying the identified approach to Australian scenarios.

Australia would adopt the stance of a theoretical future end-user, based on the recommendations of the recent parliamentary
inquiries into the feasibility and viability of nuclear power in Australia.

The project team would seek to establish strategic collaborations with project teams from vendor states to obtain necessary data
to inform the development of the Australian case study, as well as from likeminded potential end-user states with the objective
to exchange information and methodologies, and to collaborate in the completion of the agreed programs of work.

\\- make a substantive contribution to the Technical Document that will emerge from the CRP.

It is anticipated a number of research publications could emerge from the Australian project team, either directly or in
collaboration with other project participants and teams involved in the CRP. Any publications would be developed in
accordance with advice provided by the IAEA's Publishing Section to enable publication of research materials and any
resulting Intellectual Property in the project Technical Document, to which the Australian case study would be a potential
annex.

Please note that as a condition of an IAEA Research Agreement, all information, data and research results gathered during
the course of the CRP are made freely available to other participants and other relevant authorized parties.

9\\. PLEASE LIST FACILITIES (building, equipment - including type and name of manufacturer, and materials) PRESENTLY
AVAILABLE WHICH WOULD BE USED FOR THE PROJECT

ANSTO notes that this project predominantly will be undertaken via desktop study and literature review; therefore, it
is not expected that any laboratory facilities or research infrastructure will be required. ANSTO equipment, including
computer hardware and software, will be available to members of the Australian project team.
